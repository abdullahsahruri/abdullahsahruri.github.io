## Summary
<div style="text-align: justify; margin-bottom: 20px;">
  I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, where I work as a Graduate Research Assistant in analog and digital IC design. I have an MS in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Yeditepe University, where I was an honor student and a Graduate Research Assistant.
  
  <br><br>
  
  I have multiple skills and experience in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA), Verilog, AWR Microwave Office, and analog/digital IC projects for industrial applications. I am always looking for exciting work environments and new technologies, and I am interested in opportunities to expand my knowledge and experience of VLSI. My goal is to contribute to advancing nanoscale chip technology and create innovative solutions for real-world problems.
